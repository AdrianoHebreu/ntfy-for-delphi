# üîî Ntfy for Delphi 

Ntfy for Delphi it's a friendly library to work with [ntfy.sh](https://docs.ntfy.sh/) endpoints in Delphi. It allows you publishing messages and subscribing on topics to receive instant notifications. 

# ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

You need to add ```src``` folder to your library path or search path. 

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart

Push a notification on a specif topic. Topics are the same as channels and the topic's name you choose will become a public url, so remember to make difficult to guess it.

``` pascal

uses
  Notify;

begin
  Ntfy.Notification(
    New.Notification
      .Topic('your-very-secret-topic')
      .Title('üê∂ Parking with dog')
      .MessageContent('Today at 16:00hs ') 
  );

  Ntfy.Publish;
end;

```

# üí¨ Subscribe to a topic

You can subscribe to a topic through several ways. For instance, the [Web App](https://ntfy.sh/app), [Android](https://docs.ntfy.sh/subscribe/phone/), [CLI](https://docs.ntfy.sh/subscribe/cli/) or you can use this library as follows: 

``` pascal
uses
  Notify;

begin
  Ntfy.Subscribe('your-very-secret-topic', 
    procedure (AEvent: INotifyEvent);
    begin
      WriteLn('You received a message: ' +  AEvent.MessageContent)
    end);
end;

```

There is a [VCL Sample](https://github.com/p-samuel/delphi-notify/tree/main/sample/vcl) demonstration showing you how to use Delphi Ntfy subscription mechanism into your project.
