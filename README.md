# Delphi Ntfy 

Delphi Ntfy it's a friendly client interface to work with [ntfy.sh](https://docs.ntfy.sh/) endpoints in Delphi. It allows you to publish messages and to subscribe into topic channles.

# Instalation

You can add ```src``` folder to your library path or search path. Or you can simply use boss dependency manager to install:

``` cmd
  boss install github.com/p-samuel/delphi-notify
```

# Publish a message

You can create a topic to notify subcribers. As the topic's name will become a public url, remember to make it difficult to guess it.

``` pascal

uses
  Notify;

begin

  Ntfy.Notification(
    New.Notification
      .Topic('your-very-secret-topic')
      .Title('üê∂ Parking with Tobby')
      .MessageContent('Get Tobby today at 16:00hs ') 
  );

  Ntfy.Publish;

end;

```
