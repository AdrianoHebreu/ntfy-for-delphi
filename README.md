# ‚ö°Ô∏è Delphi Ntfy 

Delphi Ntfy it's a friendly library to work with [ntfy.sh](https://docs.ntfy.sh/) endpoints in Delphi. It allows you to publish messages and subscribe to topic channels to receive those same messages. It's used to push instant notifications.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

You need to add ```src``` folder to your library path or search path. 

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart

Create a message notification on a specif topic. Topics are the same as channels and the topic's name you choose will become a public url. Remember to make it difficult to guess.

``` pascal

uses
  Notify;

begin
  Ntfy.Notification(
    New.Notification
      .Topic('your-very-secret-topic')
      .Title('üê∂ Parking with dog')
      .MessageContent('Today at 16:00hs ') 
  );

  Ntfy.Publish;
end;

```

# üí¨ Subscribe to a topic

You can subscribe to a topic through several ways. For instance, the [Web App](https://ntfy.sh/app), [Android](https://docs.ntfy.sh/subscribe/phone/), [CLI](https://docs.ntfy.sh/subscribe/cli/) or you can use this library as follows: 

``` pascal

uses
  Notify;

begin
  Ntfy.Topic('your-very-secret-topic').Subscribe;
end;

```

There is a [VCL Sample](https://github.com/p-samuel/delphi-notify/tree/main/sample/vcl) demonstration showing you how to use Delphi Ntfy subscription mechanism into your project.
